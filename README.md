Introduction
The Employee CRUD application is a web-based tool that allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an employee table. The application is built on the Python Django framework, which is a powerful, flexible, and scalable web development framework. The application has a table that contains the employee data, including the employee ID, name, email, and contact information. The main goal of the application is to allow users to view the employee data, add new employees, update employee information, and delete employees from the table.
