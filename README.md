Introduction
The Employee CRUD application is a web-based tool that allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an employee table. The application is built on the Python Django framework, which is a powerful, flexible, and scalable web development framework. The application has a table that contains the employee data, including the employee ID, name, email, and contact information. The main goal of the application is to allow users to view the employee data, add new employees, update employee information, and delete employees from the table.

Features
The Employee CRUD application has the following features:

Show Table: Users can view the employee table that displays all the existing employee records.
Add: Users can add new employees to the table by filling out a form that includes the employee's name, email, and contact information.
Edit: Users can update the employee's information by clicking on the edit button for the corresponding employee record. The user will be redirected to a form that allows them to edit the employee's information.
Delete: Users can delete an employee record by clicking on the delete button for the corresponding employee.
Architecture
The Employee CRUD application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The models in the application define the data structure for the employee table. The views are responsible for rendering the user interface and responding to user actions. The controllers handle the logic for processing user input and interacting with the database.

Implementation
The Employee CRUD application is implemented using the Python Django framework. The application uses Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the employee table in the database. The views are implemented using Django's class-based views, which provide a simple and flexible way to define the application's behavior.

Conclusion
The Employee CRUD application is a simple but useful web-based tool that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on an employee table. The application is built on the Python Django framework, which provides a powerful and flexible web development environment. The application's features include viewing the employee table, adding new employees, updating employee information, and deleting employees from the table. The implementation of the application follows the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern, which makes the application easy to maintain and extend in the future.
